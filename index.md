Triplebit is a U.S. nonprofit organization and transit internet service provider (ISP) based in Minneapolis, MN.

Our mission is to protect and uphold the rights to privacy, access to information, anonymity, and free speech. To further our mission, Triplebit operates high capacity Tor exit relays and other critical privacy infrastructure.

We enhance network privacy by:

- Operating infrastructure on hardware we own
- Peering directly with major content providers and content delivery networks, reducing middlemen ISPs
