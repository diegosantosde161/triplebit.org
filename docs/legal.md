## What is Triplebit?

Triplebit is a United States-based nonprofit corporation and transit internet service provider (ISP) based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Our mission is to protect and uphold the rights to privacy, access to information, anonymity, and free speech. To further our mission, Triplebit operates high capacity Tor exit relays and other critical privacy infrastructure with direct peering to the [Midwest Internet Cooperative Exchange](https://micemn.net/index.html).

## What is Tor, and why does Triplebit run Tor Exit Routers?

Tor is a research project [funded by](https://www.torproject.org/about/sponsors.html.en) a multitude of nonprofits, NGOs, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Department of State. Its primary goal is to provide people in hostile environments with unsurveilled and uncensored access to the Internet. Running Tor exit routers is our way of supporting people that have something important to read or say and undermining global mass surveillance by oppressive regimes.

## How can I tell if an IP address is actually a Triplebit Tor Exit Router?

The Tor Project validates IP addresses of Tor routers at <https://exonerator.torproject.org/>. You can use this site to verify the status of Triplebit's Tor routers by entering the IP address in question.

## What Information Does Triplebit Retain?

Triplebit does not log any network information related to our Tor relays and exit routers, not even on our perimeter firewall and router.

## Digital Millennium Copyright Act Safe Harbor

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) offers four safe harbors to protect ISPs from copyright liability for the acts of their users, provided that certain requirements are met ([17 U.S.C. § 512](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512)). Triplebit is a section 512(a) "conduit" provider.

## Triplebit Repeat Infringer Termination Policy

Triplebit does not have subscribers or account holders and cannot identify the IP addresses of individuals who send communications over the Tor network. Nonetheless, it is our policy to terminate the use of Triplebit by repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.
